# refresh [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ok7detq1hwnbd5cc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tischda/refresh)

Windows utility written in [Go](https://www.golang.org) to refresh
environment variables.

With `refresh`, applications still need to be restarted to see the variables
changed, but at least I can keep my session without logging out or rebooting.


### Install

There are no dependencies.

~~~
go get github.com/tischda/refresh
~~~

### Usage

~~~
refresh.exe
~~~
